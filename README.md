- 👋 Hi, I’m Steven

### Things to remember:
- Variables should have a length proportional to the scope that contains them
- As the scope of the function expands, we want the function size to decrease.
- The size of a function is inversely proportional to the scope that contains it
- The size of a class is also inversely proportional to the scope it contains
